The Economic and Labour Market Context 
 
Inflation & the Labour Market
The most recent data from the Office of National Statistics shows that twelve-month inflation in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was 3.2% in November. Inflation has been higher than expected all year – at the end of 2024, it was 2.3% but climbed steadily throughout much of 2025. It is, however, finally starting to come down (it was 3.8% in August), but still sits above the Bank of England’s target of 2%. 
 
This level of inflation is likely to put upwards pressure on pay rises.  At the same time, however, the UK labour market is weakening, meaning that there is more supply than demand for workers.  This is characterised by rising unemployment, increasing from 4.2% in July 2024 to 5.1% in the latest figures (November 2025), slowing job growth, fewer job vacancies and slower wage growth. 
 
Overall, this has slightly eased recruitment pressures for some organisations as the candidate pool as significantly increased, particularly for entry-level jobs, however there is still a skill shortage and a fall in the quality of applications relative to 12 months ago. 
 
These labour market elements should act to moderate the upwards pressure on pay rises caused by the continuing stickiness of inflation.
 
Pay Rises in 2026
We anticipate that continued increases in the statutory and Real Living Wages will continue to dominate the pay landscape throughout 2026. 
 
Pay rises as a whole are forecast to sit in the region of 3.0% (CIPD Labour Market Outlook); however, the latest estimate for the statutory minimum wage is an increase of 4.1%.
 
This upwards pressure at the bottom of the market will have a longer term transformational effect on the labour market.  In the short term, we are starting to see the following:
 
1.         Differential pay rises, with the lion’s share of any increased pay pot going to those at the bottom of the market – this has resulted in some senior level salaries showing only small or no increases

 

2.         Pay compression between bottom grades and those just above, causing difficulties in creating career paths, especially for some supervisory roles

 

3.         Geographic & sector market flattening – we have seen the removal in distinction in pay both between different sectors and different regions for those roles at the bottom of the market, outside London and the inner South East.  (And the gap between London and the South East is narrowing too.)
